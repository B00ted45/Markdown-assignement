notes for the oop unit

#### OOP vs procedural programing
___
* OOP focuses on how to manipulate the data of the object rather than the logic required to manipulate them
it does this through the use of classes and objects

## Objects
___

__Object’s Data → called: attributes__


__Object’s Code → called: methods__
___
### The objects have attributes and methods 

eg creating a object for Dog

__attributes:__
Dog may have the following attributes
* Name
* Color
* Breed
* isHungry
* isThirsty

__methods__ 
Dog may have the following methods
* bark()
* eat()
* sleep()
___
## Classes
___

#### Creating a Method for a Class
```python
  class Person:
    def greet(self):
      print(‘Hello, how are you?’)
    #end of greet
    #end of class Person
    p = Person()
    p.greet() # outputs the greet message …

```

# Encapsulation
___
* Information Hiding: Restricting the access to the classes/objects’ certain attributes and methods.
*   Why?
Data Protection
Restricting certain methods to be callable
